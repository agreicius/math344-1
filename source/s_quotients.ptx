    Let <m>(X,\mathcal{T})</m> be a topological space, <m>\sim</m> an equivalence relation on <m>X</m>, <m>X^*=X/\sim</m> the set of equivalence classes of <m>\sim</m>, and <m>q\colon X\rightarrow X^*</m> the map sending <m>x\in X</m> to its equivalence class <m>[x]_\sim\in X^*</m>. The set

      \mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{quot}}=\{U\subset X^*\colon q^{-1}(U)\in \mathcal{T}\}
    </me>
    is a topology on <m>X^*</m> called the <term>quotient topology</term>. The map <m>q\colon X\rightarrow X^*</m> is a <em>quotient map</em>: that is, it is surjective and satisfies <m>V\subseteq X^*</m> is open if and only if <m>q^{-1}(V)</m> is open.
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      That <m>\mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{quot}}</m> is a topology follows easily from properties of preimages of sets; and it satisfies the quotient map properties essentially by definition.

  <proof>

    <title>Proof of (1)</title>
    <p>
      We prove <m>(a)\iff (b)</m> and <m>(b)\iff (c)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>(a)\implies (b)</m>. Assume <m>f</m> is a quotient map. Let <m>U\subseteq X</m> be open and saturated. Since <m>f</m> is a quotient map, to show <m>V=f(U)</m> is open, it is enough to show <m>f^{-1}(V)=f^{-1}(f(U))</m> is open. I claim <m>f^{-1}(f(U))=U</m>, whence the claim follows. In general for any function of sets we have <m>f^{-1}(f(U))\supseteq U</m>. (Check for yourself.) Since <m>U</m> is saturated, the reverse inclusion also holds. Indeed, if <m>x\in f^{-1}(f(U))</m>, then <m>f(x)\in f(U)</m> and thus <m>f(x)=f(u)</m> for some <m>u\in U</m>; since <m>U</m> is saturated, we have <m>x\in U</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>(b)\implies (a)</m>. Assume <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> be open for <m>V\subseteq Y</m>. We wish to show that <m>V</m> is open in <m>Y</m>. First observe that <m>f^{-1}(V)</m> is saturated: if <m>x\in f^{-1}(V)</m>, then <m>f^{-1}(\{f(x)\})\subseteq f^{-1}(V)</m>. Since <m>f</m> satisfies <m>(b)</m> and <m>U</m> is an open saturated set, we have <m>f(U)</m> open. I claim <m>f(U)=f(f^{-1}(V))=V</m>, showing <m>V</m> is open. In general we always have
      <m>f(f^{-1}(V))\subseteq V</m> for any function of sets. For the other inclusion, given <m>y\in V</m>, there is an <m>x\in X</m> such that <m>f(x)=y</m>; then <m>x\in f^{-1}(V)</m> and <m>f(x)=y</m>, showing <m>y\in f(f^{-1}(V))</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>(b)\implies (c)</m>. Let <m>C</m> be a saturated closed map. First I claim that the open set <m>U=X-C</m> is saturated. To see why, suppose <m>y=f(x)</m> for some <m>x\in U</m>. Since <m>x\notin C</m> and <m>C</m> is saturated, we must have <m>f^{-1}(\{y\})\cap C=\emptyset</m>. Thus <m>f^{-1}(\{y\})\subseteq U</m>, as desired. Next, I claim <m>f(U)=Y-f(C)</m>. We have already seen that if <m>y\in f(U)</m>, then <m>f^{-1}(\{y\})\cap C=\emptyset</m>,
      and hence <m>y\notin f(C)</m>. This proves <m>f(U)\subseteq Y-f(C)</m>. For the other inclusion, given any <m>y\in Y-f(C)</m>, by surjectivity there is some <m>x\in X</m> such that <m>f(x)=y</m>; since <m>y\notin f(C)</m> we must have <m>x\in U</m>; thus <m>y\in f(U)</m>. This proves <m>f(U)=X-f(C)</m>. Since <m>f</m> satisfies (b), <m>f(U)</m> is open. We conclude that <m>f(C)</m> is closed, as desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>(c)\implies (b)</m>. This argument is essentially identical to the one above.

      Furthermore, the function <m>f</m> is a projection map if and only if <m>g</m> is a projection map.
      </image>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume we have <m>g\colon X\rightarrow Z</m> as described. Define <m>f\colon Y\righarrow Z</m> via the following recipe: given <m>y\in Y</m>, pick any <m>x\in X</m> such that <m>p(x)=y</m> (possible since <m>p</m> is surjective); now define <m>f(y)=g(x)</m>. Two comments:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            To make sure <m>f</m> as described is well-defined, we must make sure that the definition of <m>f(y)</m> does not depend on the choice of <m>x</m> involve: <ie />, if you happen to pick another <m>x'</m> such that <m>p(x')=y</m>, we must make sure that <m>g(x)=g(x')</m>. This is precisely what is guaranteed by the condition that <m>p(x)=p(x')\implies g(x)=g(x')</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since we want <m>g=f\circ p</m>, this definition of <m>f</m> is forced upon us: given <m>y=p(x)</m>, we must have <m>f(y)=f(p(x))=g(x)</m>. Thus <m>f</m> is unique.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      Now we must show <m>f</m> is continuous. We must show, given any open <m>V\subseteq Z</m> the set <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> is open. To do so we use the fact that <m>p</m> is a quotient map: that is, we need only show that <m>p^{-1}(U)</m> is open in <m>X</m>. But we have
      <me>
        p^{-1}(U)=p^{-1}(f^{-1}(V))=(f\circ p)^{-1}(V)=g^{-1}(V),
      </me>
      since <m>g=f\circ p</m>. Since <m>g</m> is continuous, we conclude that <m>p^{-1}(U)=g^{-1}(V)</m> is open, as desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, we look at when <m>f</m> is a quotient map. If <m>f</m> is a quotient map, then so is the composition <m>g=f\circ p</m> by statement (3) of <xref ref="th_quotientmap_props"/>. Assume <m>g</m> is a quotient map. Since <m>g</m> is surjective and <m>g=f\circ p</m>, it follows that <m>f</m> must be surjective. Now suppose <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> is open in <m>Y</m>. Since <m>p</m> is continuous, <m>p^{-1}(U)</m> is open in <m>X</m>. As we saw above, <m>p^{-1}(U)=g^{-1}(V)</m>, which is a saturated open set of <m>X</m>. Since <m>g</m> is a quotient map, the set <m>g(g^{-1}(V))</m>
       is open. But again, because <m>g</m> is surejective, we have <m>g(g^{-1}(V))=V</m>.

      First a remark about why we proceed in this manner. If we wanted to prove <m>X^*</m> is homeomorphic to <m>S^1</m>, it might seem more natural to consider the diagram

Using <xref ref="cor_quotientspace_props"/>, we get a bijective continuous function <m>f\colon X^*\rightarrow S^1</m>. The difficulty lies in showing this is a homeomorphism; or equivalently, showing that <m>g</m> is a quotient map. Once we learn about compactness, it will be easy to show that <m>g</m> is in fact a closed map, and thus a quotient map by <xref ref="th_quotientmap_props"/>. With our current tools, however, this is not so straightforward. So we follow the steps proposed.

        where <m>g</m> is defined as <m>g(t)=[t]\in \R/\Z</m>. I claim <m>g</m> is a quotient map and satisfies <m>g(t)=g(t')\iff t\sim t'</m>. It will follow from <xref ref="cor_quotientspace_props"/> that the <m>f</m> in our diagram is a homeomorphism. First note that <m>g</m> is just the restriction of the quotient map <m>\R\rightarrow \R/\Z</m> to <m>[0,1]\subseteq \R</m>. Thus it is continuous. It is surjective since for any <m>t'\in \R</m> there is a <m>t\in [0,1]</m> such that <m>t'=t+n</m> for some integer
        <m>n\in \Z</m>. Furthermore, for <m>t,t'\in [0,1]</m>, we have <m>t\sim t'</m> if and only if <m>t,t'\in \{0,1\}</m>, if and only if <m>g(t)=g(t')</m>. Lastly, to see that <m>g</m> is a quotient map we use <xref ref="th_quotient_subspace"/> and the fact that <m>[0,1]</m> is a closed saturated subset of .
