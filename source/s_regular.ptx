<title>Separation axioms</title>
<p>
    The properties of being <m>T_1</m>, Hausdorff, regular, or normal are called <em>separation axioms</em> as they articulate how various subsets can be separated by open sets. Below you find the descriptions of these properties using the <foreign>Trennungsaxiom</foreign> schema.
    <me>
        \begin{array}{r|l}
        \text{Name} \amp T_n \\
        \hline 
        T_1 \amp T_1 \\
        \text{Hausdorff} \amp T_2 \\ 
        \text{Regular} \amp T_3 \\ 
        \text{Normal} \amp T_4
        \end{array}
    </me>
    A further remark about the use of <q>regular</q> and <q>normal</q> in the literature: some texts do not include the <m>T_1</m> condition in these notions, and describe the properties we define as <q>regular Hausdorff</q> and <q>normal regular</q>. There is considerably less ambiguity in the literature when using the <m>T_n</m> descriptions, but you should still be careful.

    <title>Trennungsaxiom implications</title>
    <p>
        It is easy to see that <m>T_4\implies T_3\implies T_2\implies T_1</m>. Furthermore, your argument for the first two implications will reveal why the <m>T_1</m> condition is needed.

           If  <m>X</m> is a metric space, then <m>X</m> is normal.

    <proof>
        <p>
            Let <m>A,B</m> be disjoint closed subsets of <m>X</m>. For each <m>a\in A</m> we can find an <m>\epsilon_a&gt; 0 </m> such that <m>B_{\epsilon_a}(a)\cap B=\emptyset</m>. Similarly for each <m>b\in B</m> we can find an <m>\epsilon_b&gt; 0</m> such that <m>B_{\epsilon_b}(b)\cap A=\emptyset</m>. I claim the open sets 
            <md>

            </md>
            are disjoint, proving <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are separated by open sets. Indeed if  <m>x\in U\cap V</m>, then <m>x\in B_{\epsilon_a/2}(a)\cap B_{\epsilon_b/2}(b)</m> for some <m>a\in A</m> and <m>b\in B</m>. Without loss of generality we may assume that <m>\epsilon_a\geq \epsilon_b</m>. But then we would have 
            <md>
                <mrow>d(x,b) \amp \geq d(a,b)-d(a,x) \amp (\text{triangle ineq.}) </mrow>

                <mrow> \amp \geq \epsilon_b/2</mrow>
            </md>. 
            This is a contradiction since we assumed <m>x\in B_{\epsilon_b/2}(b)</m>.

    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            Since the <m>K</m>-topology is finer than the standard topology on <m>\R</m>, <m>\R_K</m> is Hausdorff. To see that it is not regular, recall that <m>K=\{1/n\colon n\in \Z_+\}</m> is closed. I'll show that we cannot separate 0 and <m>K</m> with open sets. Indeed, suppose we have open disjoint sets <m>U, V</m> containing <m>0, K</m> respectively. Since <m>U</m> is open, it must contain an open basis element $B$ containing <m>0</m>; and since <m>U\cap K=\emptyset</m>, this basis element can be chosen of the form <m>(-\epsilon, \epsilon)-K</m>. Now choose <m>n\in \Z_+</m> such that <m>1/n\in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)</m>. Since <m>1/n\in K</m> we can find a basis element of the form <m>(1/n-\delta, 1/n+\delta)</m> that is contained in <m>V</m>. Furthermore, shrinking <m>\delta</m> if necessary, we can assume that <m>(1/n-\delta, 1/n+\delta)\subseteq (-\epsilon, \epsilon)</m>. But then clearly <m>(1/n-\delta, 1/n+\delta)\cap \left((-\epsilon, \epsilon)-K\right)\ne\emptyset</m>, and hence also <m>U\cap V\ne \emptyset</m>. Contradiction!

                    <p>
                        First, assume <m>X</m> is regular. Given <m>x</m> and <m>U</m> as described, we can separate <m>\{x\}</m> and the closed set <m>C=X-U</m> by open sets <m>V</m> and <m>V'</m>. It follows that <m>\overline{V}\subseteq U</m>: indeed, given any <m>y\in X-U=C</m>, the open set <m>V'</m> contains <m>y</m> and does not intersect with <m>V</m>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conversely, assume for all <m>x\in X</m> and open sets <m>U\ni x</m> we can find an open set <m>V</m> satisfying <m>x\in V\subseteq\overline{V}\subseteq U</m>. Given any closed set <m>C</m> and element <m>x\notin X</m>, letting <m>U=X-C</m>, we see that there is an open set <m>V</m> satisfying <m>x\in V\subseteq \overline{V}\subseteq U</m>.
