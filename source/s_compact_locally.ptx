    </statement>
    <proof>
        <p>
            It is clear that (2) implies (1): for any <m>x\in X</m>, taking <m>U=X</m>, we get an open neighborhood <m>V\ni x</m> such that <m>\overline{V}</m> is compact. Thus <m>K</m> is a compact neighborhood of <m>x</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We now show (1) implies (2). Munkres' proof elegantly uses the one-point compactification of <m>X</m>. Solely by way of contrast I proceed more directly. Fix <m>x\in X</m> and open neighborhood <m>U\ni x</m>. Since <m>X</m> is locally compact, we have <m>x\in U'\subseteq K</m> for some open set <m>U'</m> and compact set <m>K</m>. Taking <m>U'\cap U</m> we may assume further that <m>U'\subseteq U</m>. The set <m>C=K-U</m> is a closed subset of the compact set <m>K</m>, hence compact. Since <m>X</m> is Hausdorff, we can find disjoint open sets <m>V', W'</m> containing <m>x</m> and <m>C</m>, respectively. (See <xref ref="th_compact_Haus_closed"/>.) Let <m>V=V'\cap U</m>. Since <m>\overline{V}\subseteq K</m> is a closed subset of a compact set, it is compact. Furthermore, since <m>\overline{V}</m> is disjoint from <m>C=K-U</m>, we must have <m>V\subseteq\overline{V}\subseteq U</m>.

    <proof>
        <p>
            That (1) implies (2) follows from <xref ref="th_onepoint_compactification"/>. For the converse, assume <m>X</m> is homeomorphic to the open set <m>U\subseteq Y</m>, where <m>Y</m> is compact and Hausdorff. We may use the homeomorphism to identify <m>X</m> with <m>U</m>: thus we think of <m>X\subseteq Y</m> as an open subspace of <m>Y</m>. Now, since <m>Y</m> is compact, it is locally compact. Hence by <xref ref="cor_locallycompact_char"/>, given any <m>x\in X</m> we can find an open <m>V\ni x</m> such that <m>\overline{V}\subseteq X</m> and <m>\overline{V}</m> is compact. This shows that every <m>x\in X</m> has a compact neighborhoof <m>K=\overline{V}\subseteq X</m>, as desired.
