  <title>Path</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A <term>path</term> in (or to) a topological space <m>X</m> is a continuous function <m>f\colon [a,b]\rightarrow X</m>, where <m>[a,b]\subseteq \R</m> is a closed interval. We call <m>f(a)=x</m> the <term>start point</term> (or <term>initial point</term>) and <m>f(b)=x'</m> the <term>end point</term> (or <term>terminal point</term>) of the path <m>f</m>.

  <title>Path-connected space</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space. Two elements <m>x, x'\in X</m> are <term>connected by a path in <m>X</m></term> if there is a path <m>f\colon [a,b]\rightarrow X</m> such that <m>f(a)=x</m> and <m>f(b)=x'</m>. The space <m>X</m> is <term>path connected</term> if any two elements of <m>X</m> are connected by a path.

<theorem xml:id="th_path_connected">
  <title>Path-connected implies connected</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>X</m> is path connected, then <m>X</m> is connected. Using logical shorthand:
      <me>
        X \text{ path connected}\implies X \text{ connected}.
      </me>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume by contradiction that <m>X=U_1\cup U_2</m> is a separation of <m>X</m>. We can find points <m>x_1\in U_1, x_2\in U_2</m>. Let <m>f\colon [a,b]\rightarrow X</m> be a path connecting <m>x, x'</m>. By <xref ref="th_connected_continuous"/>, the image <m>f([a.b])</m> is connected. By <xref ref="th_connected_subspace"/> we must have <m>f([a,b])\subseteq U_1</m> or <m>f([a,b])\subseteq U_2</m>. This contradicts the fact that <m>f(a)=x_1\in U_1, f(b)=x_2\in U_2</m>
      and <m>U_1\cap U_2=\emptyset</m>. Thus there can be no separation of <m>X</m>, and we conclude that it is connected.
    </p>

<theorem xml:id="th_path_connected_continuous">
  <title>Path-connectedness and continuity</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is continuous and <m>X</m> is path connected, then <m>f(X)</m> is path connected.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Given <m>y=f(x)</m> and <m>y'=f(x')</m>, let <m>\phi\colon [a,b]\rightarrow X</m> be a path connecting <m>x</m> and <m>x'</m>. The composition <m>f\circ \phi</m> is then a path connecting <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m>.

  <title>Balls in <m>\R^n</m></title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>X=\R^n</m> be Euclidean <m>n</m>-space. For all <m>\epsilon &gt;0</m> and any <m>\boldx\in \R^n</m>, the open ball <m>B_\epsilon(\boldx)</m> is connected, as is the closed ball <m>\overline{B}_\epsilon(\boldx)</m> defined as
      <me>
        \overline{B}_{\epsilon}(\boldx)=\{\boldy\colon d(\boldy,\boldx)\leq \epsilon\}.
      </me>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      It is easy to see that the straight line path <m>\phi\colon[0,1]\rightarrow \R^n</m> defined as <m>\phi(t)=(1-t)\boldx+t\boldy</m> is a continuous function connecting any two points in <m>\R^n</m>. For our current purposes, we wish to show that if <m>\boldy\in B_{\epsilon}(\boldx)</m>, then so is <m>(1-t)\boldx+t\boldy</m>, for any <m>t\in [0,1]</m>. To this end, note that 
      <md>
        <mrow>d(\phi(t),\boldx)\amp =\norm{(1-t)\boldx+t\boldy-\boldx}  </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\norm{t(\boldy-\boldx)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\abs{t}d(\boldy,\boldx)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp \leq \epsilon \amp (0\leq t\leq 1)</mrow>     
      </md>.
      This proves that the open ball is path connected, and hence connected. Next, it is easy to see that the closed ball is in fact the closure of the open ball. Since connectedness is preserved under closure, we conclude that the closed ball is connected.

  <title>Punctured Euclidean space <m>\R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m>: <m>n\geq 2</m></title>
  <statement>
    <p>
        Let <m>X=\R^n</m> be Euclidean <m>n</m>-space, where <m>n\geq 2</m>. The subspace <m>\R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m> is connected.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Take any <m>\boldx,\boldy\in \R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m>. If the two vectors are not scalar multiples of one another, then the straight line path connecting them is guaranteed to lie in <m>\R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m>, using a linear independence argument. If <m>\boldy=c\span x</m>, then since <m>\dim \R^n\geq 2</m>, we can find a vector <m>\boldz\in \R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m> that is not a scalar multiple of either vector. We can then construct a polygonal path lieing in <m>\R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m> that first connects <m>\boldx</m> to <m>\boldz</m> via a straight line path, and then connects <m>\boldz</m> to <m>\boldy</m> via a straight line path.
