    <statement>
        <p>
         Let <m>Y</m> be a subset of the topological space <m>X</m>. An <term>open covering </term> of <m>Y</m> is a collection of open sets <m>\mathcal{U}=\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</m> such that <m>Y\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i</m>. As a shorthand, we will often simply say in this case that <m>Y=\subseteq_{i\in I}U_i</m> is an open covering.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Note in particular that an open covering of <m>X</m> itself is a collection of open sets <m>\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</m> satisfying <m>X=\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i</m>.

  <statement>
    <p>
      A topologial space <m>X</m> is <term>compact</term> if every open covering of <m>X</m> has a finite subcovering: <ie/>, if <m>X=\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i</m> is an open covering, then there is a finite set <m>\{i_1,i_2,\dots,i_n\}\subseteq I</m> such that <m>X=\bigcup_{j=1}^n U_{i_j}</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A subset <m>Y\subseteq X</m> is compact, if it is compact with respect to the subspace topology. Equivalently, <m>Y</m> is compact if any covering <m>Y\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i</m> by open sets of <m>X</m> has a finite subcovering.

                <m>\R</m> is not compact. Consequently, since compactness is a topological property (<ie/>, preserved by homeomorphisms), no open interval is compact.

        Show that <m>Y=K\cup\{0\}=\{1/n\colon n\in \Z_+\}\cup\{0\}</m> is a compact subset of <m>\R</m>.

    <!-- <solution>
        <p>
            Let <m> \mathcal{U}=\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</m> be an open covering of <m>Y</m>, so that <m>Y\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i</m>. We have <m>0\in U_{i_0}</m> for some <m>i_1\in I</m>. Since <m>U_{i_0}</m> is open, there is an <m>N</m> such that <m>(-1/N, 1/N)\subseteq U_{i_0}</m>. It follows that <m>U_{i_0}</m> contains all of <m>Y</m> except possibly the elements <m>\{1, 1/2, \dots, 1/N\}</m> Now pick open sets <m>U_{i_k}</m> containing <m>1/k</m> for each <m>1\leq k\leq n</m>. It follows that <m>Y\subseteq \bigcup_{k=0}^NU_{i_k}</m> is a finite subcovering of <m>\mathcal{U}</m>.
