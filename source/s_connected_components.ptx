      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space. A subset <m>A\subseteq X</m> is <term>maximally connected</term> (resp., <term>maximally path connected</term>) if <m>A</m> is connected (resp. path connected), and if for all connected (resp. path connected) sets <m>B</m>, if <m>A\subseteq B</m>, then <m>A=B</m>. A <term>connected component</term> (resp., <term>path-connected component</term>) of <m>X</m> is a maximally connected (resp. path connected) subset of <m>X</m>.

        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space.

            <li>
                <p>
                    All connected components of <m>X</m> are closed. (This is not necessarily the case for path-connected components.)

                <p>
                    If <m>A</m> is connected (resp. path connected) and <m>C</m> is a connected component (resp. path connected component) of <m>X</m>, then either <m>A\cap C=\emptyset</m> or <m>A\subseteq C</m>.

                    The set of all connected components (resp. path-connected components) of <m>X</m> forms a partition of <m>X</m>. In other words, every element of <m>X</m> lies in a component (connected or path connected), and any two distinct components are disjoint. 
                </p>

           <li>
            <p>
                Each connected component of <m>X</m> is a partition of path-connected components. 
            </p>
           </li>

        </p>

    <proof>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>C</m> be a connected component. Since <m>C\subseteq\overline{C}</m> and <m>\overline{C}</m> is connected, we have <m>C=\overline{C}</m>. Thus <m>C</m> is closed. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose <m>A</m> is connected. If <m>A\cap C\ne\emptyset</m>, then <m>A\cup C</m> is connected by (2) of <xref ref="th_connected_subspace"/>. Since <m>C</m> is maximally connected, we have <m>A\cup C=C</m>. Thus <m>A\subseteq C</m>. A similar argument applies to path connected components. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>C_1, C_2</m> be connected components. By the previous result, since <m>C_2</m> is maximally connected, if <m>C_1\cap C_2\ne \emptyset</m>, then <m>C_1\subseteq C_2</m>. Since <m>C_1</m> is maximally connected, <m>C_1=C_2</m>. This proves that any two distinct connected components are disjoint. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Next given any <m>x\in X</m>, let <m>\mathcal{C}</m> be the set of all connected sets containing <m>x</m>. Note that <m>\\mathcal{C}</m> is nonempty since <m>\{x\}\in \mathcal{C}</m>. The set <m>C_x=\bigcup_{C\in \mathcal{C}}C</m> is easily seen to be a connected component containing <m>x</m>. Thus every element of <m>x</m> is contained in a connected component. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, the argument for path connected components is very similar. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For each <m>x\in X</m> let <m>C_x</m> denote the (unique) connected component containing <m>x</m>, and let <m>P_x</m> denote the (unique) path connected component containing <m>x</m>. Let <m>C</m> be a connected component of <m>X</m>.  For any <m>x\in X</m> we have <m>P_x\cap C\ne\emptyset</m>; since <m>P_x</m> is path connected, it is connected, and hence <m>P_x\subseteq C</m> by (1) above. It follows that <m>C=\bigcup_{x\in C}P_x</m> is a partition of <m>C</m> by path connected components.

  <title>Locally connected space</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A topological space <m>X</m> is <term>locally connected</term> (resp. <term>locally path connected</term>) at a point <m>x\in X</m> if for all open sets <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>, there is an open connected (resp. open path connected set) <m>V</m> such that <m>x\in V</m> and <m>V\subseteq U</m>.  The space <m>X</m> is <term>locally connected</term> (resp., <term>locally path connected</term>) if it is locally connected (resp., locally path connected) at all <m>x\in X</m>. 
    </p>
  </statement>

<remark xml:id="rm_locally_connected">
  <title>Connected does not imply locally connected</title>
  <p>
    Somewhat curiously, a space being connected does not necessarily imply that the space is locally connected. For example, the <xref ref="top_eg_topologist_sine_curve" text="custom">topologist's sine curve </xref> <m>\overline{S}</m> is connected, but not locally connected. For example, take the point <m>P=(0,0)\in \overline{S}</m> and the open set <m>U=[0,1]\times (-1/2,1/2)\cap \overline{S}</m>.  Graphically, it is easy to see that <m>U</m> has a connected component partition consisting of <m>\{0\}\times (-1/2,1/2)</m> and infinitely many connected segments of the graph of <m>f(x)=\sin (1/x)</m> (one segment for each interval of the form <m>(1/(\pi/6+\pi n), 1/(-\pi/6+\pi n)</m> that lies in <m>[0,1]</m>). Any open connected set containing <m>(0,0)</m> would have to lie in the connected component <m>\{0\}\times (-1/2,1/2)</m>; but this is impossible since <m>\{0\}\times (-1/2, 1/2)</m> does not contain any open sets!
