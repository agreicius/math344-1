  <statement>
    <p>
      A topological space <m>X</m> is <term>locally connected</term> (resp. <term>locally path connected</term>) at a point <m>x\in X</m> if for all open sets <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>, there is an open connected (resp. open path connected set) <m>V</m> such that <m>x\in V</m> and <m>V\subseteq U</m>.  The space <m>X</m> is <term>locally connected</term> (resp., <term>locally path connected</term>) if it is locally connected (resp., locally path connected) at all <m>x\in X</m>.

<remark xml:id="rm_locally_connected">
  <title>Connected does not imply locally connected</title>
  <p>
    Somewhat curiously, a space being connected does not necessarily imply that the space is locally connected. For example, the <xref ref="top_eg_topologist_sine_curve" text="custom">topologist's sine curve </xref> <m>\overline{S}</m> is connected, but not locally connected. For example, take the point <m>P=(0,0)\in \overline{S}</m> and the open set <m>U=[0,1]\times (-1/2,1/2)\cap \overline{S}</m>.  Graphically, it is easy to see that <m>U</m> has a connected component partition consisting of <m>\{0\}\times (-1/2,1/2)</m> and infinitely many connected segments of the graph of <m>f(x)=\sin (1/x)</m> (one segment for each interval of the form <m>(1/(\pi/6+\pi n), 1/(-\pi/6+\pi n)</m> that lies in <m>[0,1]</m>). Any open connected set containing <m>(0,0)</m> would have to lie in the connected component <m>\{0\}\times (-1/2,1/2)</m>; but this is impossible since <m>\{0\}\times (-1/2, 1/2)</m> does not contain any open sets!
