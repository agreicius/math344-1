  <title>Product space (arbitrary)</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>\{X_i\}_{i\in I}</m> be a collection of topological spaces. We define two distinct topologies on the the product <m>X=\prod_{i\in I} X_i</m>.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <title>Box topology</title>
          <p>
            The <term>box topology</term> on <m>X</m> is the topology generated by the basis
            <me>
              \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{box}}=\left\{\prod_{i\in I}U_i\colon U_i \text{ open in } X_i\right\}
            </me>.

        <li>
          <title>Product topology</title>
          <p>
            The <term>product topology</term> on <m>X</m> is the topology generated by the basis
            <me>
              \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{prod}}=\left\{\prod_{i\in I}U_i\colon U_i \text{ open in } X_i, U_i=X_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i\in I\right\}
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    When the index set <m>I</m> is finite, these two topologies are equal, and both are called the product topology.
    </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      To see that both collections are indeed bases, observe that for any <m>x=(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> we have <m>x=(x_i)_{i\in I}\in \prod_{i\in I}X_i</m>, which is an element of <m>\mathcal{B}</m> in both cases; and that in both cases if we have <m>U=\prod_{i\in I}U_i</m>, <m>V=\prod_{i\in I}V_i\in \mathcal{B}</m>, then
      <me>
        \left(\prod_{i\in I}U_i \right)\times \left(\prod_{i\in I}V_i \right) =\prod_{i\in I}U_i\cap V_i
      </me>,
      is also an element of <m>\mathcal{B}</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

    <remark xml:id="rm_box_product">
      <title>Product coarser than box</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      It is clear from the definition that we always have <m>\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{prod}}\subseteq \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{box}}</m>, and hence the product topology is coarser than (contained in) the box topology.
    </p>
  </statement>

<example xml:id="eg_product_binary">
  <title><m>\{0,1\}^\Z</m></title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>X=\{0,1\}^\Z=\{(a_i)_{i=1}^n\colon a_i\in \{0,1\}\}</m>. Compare the box and product topologies on <m>X</m>, where <m>\{0,1\}</m> is given the discrete topology.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      As observed in <xref ref="rm_box_product"/>, the product topology is always contained in the box topology. Let's show that in this case the containment is strict. Since <m>\{1\}</m> is open in <m>\{0,\1}</m>, the set
      <me>
        U=\{1\}\times \{1\}\times \cdots =\{(1,1,\dots )\}
      </me>
      is open in the box topology. To see that it is not open in the product topology, take <m>x=(1,1,1,\dots, )</m> and let <m>V\in \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{prod}}</m> contains <m>x</m>. By definition, we have
      <me>
        V=\prod_{i=1}^n V_i=V_1\times V_2\times \cdots \times V_N\times \{0,1\}\times \{0,1\}\times \cdots
      </me>
      for some <m>N</m>,
      where <m>V_{i}</m> is an open subset of <m>\{0,1\}</m>. Since <m>x\in V</m>, we have <m>\{1\}\subseteq V_i\ne\emptyset</m>. Since <m>V_i=\{0,1\}</m> for all <m>i\geq N</m>, the element <m>(1,1,\dots, 1,0,0,\dots)\in V</m>, from which it follows that <m>V\not\subseteq U</m>. We conclude that <m>U</m> is not a union of basis elements of the product topology, and hence is not open in the product topology.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to see that <m>\{0,1\}^\Z</m> is discrete in the box topology. The argument above shows that <m>\{0,1\}^\Z</m> is not discrete in the product topology, since the singleton <m>\{(1,1,\dots, 1)\}</m> is not open.
