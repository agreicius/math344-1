  <title>Homeomorphisms</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Consider the two spaces <m>X=\{1,2\}</m> and <m>Y=\{3,4\}</m>, both equipped with the discrete topology. As sets they are clearly not equal; and yet considered as topological spaces they are essentially the same. Indeed, we call both spaces the discrete topological space on a set of two elements. The notion of a <em>homeomorphism</em> gives us a rigorous way of determining when two spaces are <q>essentially the same thing, topologically speaking</q>.

  <title>Homeomorphism</title>

  
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be topological spaces. A function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is a <term>homeomorphism</term> if the following conditions are satisfied:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f</m> is continuous;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f</m> is invertible (equivalently, <m>f</m> is bijective);
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            the inverse function <m>f^{-1}\colon Y\rightarrow X</m> is continuous.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      Two spaces are <term>homeomorphic</term> if there is a homeomorphism between them.

    <remark xml:id="rm_homeomorphism">
  <title>Homeomorphism: inverse must be continuous</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      You may have met analogs of the homeomorphism in other areas of mathematics: <eg />, in linear algebra or group theory. In category theory it is what is called an <em>isomorphism</em>. The basic idea is that once you decide what the <q>structure-preserving</q> maps are between objects (continuous functions for topological spaces, linear transformations for vector spaces, homomorphisms for groups), an isomorphism is essentially just an <em>invertible</em> structure-preserving map: a vector space isomorphism is an invertible linear transformation; a group isomorphism is an invertible group homomorphism. The only subtlety is that you want the inverse of this invertible function to also be structure preserving! For linear transformations and group homomorphisms this is automatic. Not so for continuous functions! The inverse of an invertible continuous function need not be continuous, as the example below illustrates.
    </p>

<example xml:id="eg_homeomorphism_not_">
  <title>Homeomorphism: inverse must be continuous</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\R_{\operatorname{std}}</m> and <m>\R_{\operatorname{disc}}</m> be the spaces obtained by equipping <m>\R</m> with the standard and discrete topologies, respectively. The identity function
      <md>
      <mrow>  \id_\R\colon \R_{\operatorname{disc}}\amp\rightarrow \R_{\operatorname{std}}</mrow>
      <mrow>  x\amp\mapsto x </mrow>
      </md>
      is clearly continuous and invertible. In fact, we have <m>\id_\R^{-1}=\id_\R</m>. However, <m>\id_\R\colon \R_{\operatorname{std}}\rightarrow \R_{\operatorname{disc}}</m> is not continuous. Indeed, <m>U=[0,1)</m> is open in <m>\R_{\operatorname{disc}}</m>, but <m>\id_\R^{-1}(U)=[0,1)</m> is not open in <m>\R_{\operatorname{std}}</m>. Thus <m>\id_{\R_{\operatorname{disc}}}\colon \R_{\operatorname{std}}\rightarrow \R</m>
      is an invertible continuous function that is not a homeomorphism.
    </p>
  </statement>
</example>
    <remark xml:id="rm_homeomorphic_equivalence_relation">
  <title>Homeomorphic equivalence relation </title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      For topological spaces <m>X, Y</m>, define the relation <m>X\sim Y</m> to mean <m>X</m> is homeomorphic to <m>Y</m>. This relation is an equivalence relation. That is, for all topological spaces <m>X, Y, Z</m> we have
      <md>
        <mrow> X\amp\sim X \amp \text{(reflexive)}</mrow>
        <mrow> X\sim Y\amp\iff Y\sim X \amp \text{(symmetric)}</mrow>
        <mrow> X\sim Y \text{ and } Y\sim Z \amp \implies X\sim Z \amp \text{(transitive)}</mrow>
      </md>.
      These three properties follow from the simple facts that (1) the identity map is a homeomorphism, (2) the inverse of a homeomorphism is a homeomomoprhism, (3) the composition of homeomorphisms is a homeomorphism.

      Don't be mislead by <xref ref="th_homeo_open_closed"/> into thinking that being an open continuous map is equivalent to being a closed continuous map; we need the additional assumption of invertibility to guarantee equivalence. As an example, consider any constant function from <m>\R</m> to itself: this is clearly continuous and closed, but not open.

  In light of <xref ref="th_product_universal_prop"/>, it is natural to ask whether given topological spaces <m>(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)</m> there is a space <m>X</m> with continuous maps <m>X_i\rightarrow X</m> that satisfies a dual mapping property to that of the product.
