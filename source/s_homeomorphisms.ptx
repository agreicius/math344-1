  <title>Homeomorphisms</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Consider the two spaces <m>X=\{1,2\}</m> and <m>Y=\{3,4\}</m>, both equipped with the discrete topology. As sets they are clearly not equal; and yet considered as topological spaces they are essentially the same. Indeed, we call both spaces the discrete topological space on a set of two elements. The notion of a <em>homeomorphism</em> gives us a rigorous way of determining when two spaces are <q>essentially the same thing, topologically speaking</q>.

      Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be topological spaces. A function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is a <term>homeomorphism</term> if the following conditions are satisfied:

    <remark xml:id="rm_homeomorphism">
  <title>Homeomorphism: inverse must be continuous</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      You may have met analogs of the homeomorphism in other areas of mathematics: <eg />, in linear algebra or group theory. In category theory it is what is called an <em>isomorphism</em>. The basic idea is that once you decide what the <q>structure-preserving</q> maps are between objects (continuous functions for topological spaces, linear transformations for vector spaces, homomorphisms for groups), an isomorphism is essentially just an <em>invertible</em> structure-preserving map: a vector space isomorphism is an invertible linear transformation; a group isomorphism is an invertible group homomorphism. The only subtlety is that you want the inverse of this invertible function to also be structure preserving! For linear transformations and group homomorphisms this is automatic. Not so for continuous functions! The inverse of an invertible continuous function need not be continuous, as the example below illustrates.
    </p>
  </statement>

<example xml:id="eg_homeomorphism_not_">
  <title>Homeomorphism: inverse must be continuous</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\R_{\operatorname{std}}</m> and <m>\R_{\operatorname{disc}}</m> be the spaces obtained by equipping <m>\R</m> with the standard and discrete topologies, respectively. The identity function
      <md>
      <mrow>  \id_\R\colon \R_{\operatorname{disc}}\amp\rightarrow \R_{\operatorname{std}}</mrow>
      <mrow>  x\amp\mapsto x </mrow>
      </md>
      is clearly continuous and invertible. In fact, we have <m>\id_\R^{-1}=\id_\R</m>. However, <m>\id_\R\colon \R_{\operatorname{std}}\rightarrow \R_{\operatorname{disc}}</m> is not continuous. Indeed, <m>U=[0,1)</m> is open in <m>\R_{\operatorname{disc}}</m>, but <m>\id_\R^{-1}(U)=[0,1)</m> is not open in <m>\R_{\operatorname{std}}</m>. Thus <m>\id_{\R_{\operatorname{disc}}}\colon \R_{\operatorname{std}}\rightarrow \R</m>
      is an invertible continuous function that is not a homeomorphism.

  </statement>

  <title>Homeomorphic equivalence relation </title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      For topological spaces <m>X, Y</m>, define the relation <m>X\sim Y</m> to mean <m>X</m> is homeomorphic to <m>Y</m>. This relation is an equivalence relation. That is, for all topological spaces <m>X, Y, Z</m> we have

        <mrow> X\amp\sim X \amp \text{(reflexive)}</mrow>
        <mrow> X\sim Y\amp\iff Y\sim X \amp \text{(symmetric)}</mrow>
        <mrow> X\sim Y \text{ and } Y\sim Z \amp \implies X\sim Z \amp \text{(transitive)}</mrow>
      </md>.
      These three properties follow from the simple facts that (1) the identity map is a homeomorphism, (2) the inverse of a homeomorphism is a homeomomoprhism, (3) the composition of homeomorphisms is a homeomorphism.

<example xml:id="eg_R_interval">
  <title>All open intervals of <m>\R</m> are homeomorphic</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      In the following, all intervals are treated as metric spaces with the Euclidean metric on <m>\R</m>. Make use of any function whose continuity properties are well known.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prove that any finite open interval <m>(a,b)</m> is homeomorphic to <m>(0,1)</m>.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>(-\pi/2, \pi/2)</m> and <m>\R</m> are homeomorphic.

      <li>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>(a,\infty)</m> and <m>(-\infty, b)</m> are both homeomorphic to <m>\R</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Explain why we may now conclude that all open intervals of <m>\R</m> are homeomorphic.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </statement>
  <solution>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      The function <m>f\colon (0,1)\rightarrow (a,b)</m> defined as <m>f(x)=a+(b-a)x</m> is linear (hence continuous) and has continuous inverse <m>f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x-a}{b-a}</m>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The function <m>\tan\colon (-\pi/2,\pi/2)\rightarrow \R</m> is continuous and has continuous inverse <m>f^{-1}(x)=\arctan x</m>.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The functions <m>f\colon (a,\infty)\rightarrow \R</m>, <m>f(x)=\ln(x-a)</m>, and <m>g\colon (-\infty, b)\rightarrow \R</m>, <m>g(x)=\ln(b-x)</m> are continuous and have continuous inverses <m>f^{-1}(x)=e^x+a</m> and <m>g^{-1}(x)=b-e^{x}</m>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This is now the result of the fact that being homeomorphic is an equivalence relation. In more detail, from (1) we know that all finite open intervals are homeomorphic; this in conjunction with (2) shows that all finite open intervals are homemorphic to <m>\R</m>. From (3) we conclude that all half-finite intervals are homeomorphic to <m>\R</m>. Since any open interval is either finite, half-finite, or equal to <m>\R</m>, we conclude that all open intervals are homeomorphic.

<theorem xml:id="th_product_universal_prop">
  <title>Universal property of product space</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\{X_i, \mathcal{T}_i\}_{i\in I}</m> be a collection of topological spaces, and let <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m> equipped with the product topology. Let <m>\pi_i\colon X\rightarrow X_i</m> be the <m>i</m>-th projection map.

        <title>Product mapping property</title>
        <p>
          Given any topological space <m>Y</m> and any collection <m>\{f_i\}_{i\in I}</m> of continuous maps <m>f_i\colon Y\rightarrow X_i</m>, there is a <em>unique</em> continuous map <m>f\colon Y\rightarrow X</m> satisfying <m>f_i=\pi_i\circ f</m> for all <m>i\in I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, specifying a continuous map into the product space <m>X</m> is equivalent to specifying continuous maps into <m>X_i</m> for all <m>i\in I</m>

        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, up to homeomorphism, the mapping property uniquely characterizes the product space.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          First observe that equality for elements <m>x=(x_i)_{i\in I}, y=(y_i)_{i\in I}</m> in <m>X</m> can be express in terms of the projection maps as follows:
          <me>
            x=y \iff x_i=y_i \text{ for all } i\in I \iff \pi_i(x)=\pi_i(y) \text{ for all } i\in I
          </me>.
        Using this fact, we see that given a function <m>f\colon Y\rightarrow X</m> we have
          <md>
            <mrow>f_i=\pi_i\circ f \text{ for all } i\in I \amp \iff f_i(y)=\pi_i(f(y)) \text{ for all } y\in Y, i\in I </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \iff f(y)=(f_i(y))_{i\in I} </mrow>
          </md>.
          Thus the function <m>f(y)=(f_i(y))_{i\in I}</m> is the unique function from <m>Y</m> to <m>X</m> satisfying <m>f_i=\pi_i\circ f</m> for all <m>i\in I</m>. To see that this <m>f</m> is continuous, we show that <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open for any base open set <m>B\subseteq X</m>. For such a <m>B</m> we have <m>B=\prod_{j=1}^n U_j\times \prod_{i\ne j}X_i</m> for some open sets <m>U_j\subseteq X_j</m>,
          <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>. By definition of <m>f</m> we have <m>f(y)\in B</m> if and only if <m>(f_i(y))_{i\in I}\in B</m> if and only if <m>f_j(y)\in U_j</m> for all <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>. Thus <m>f^{-1}(U)=\cap_{j=1}^nf_i^{-1}(U_i)</m>. Since each <m>f_j</m> is continuous, we conclude that <m>f_j^{-1}(U_j)</m> is open for all <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>, and hence <m>f^{-1}(U)</m> is open.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>X'</m> together with continuous maps <m>\pi_i'\colon X\rightarrow X_i</m> be any other space that satisfies the product mapping property (1). By (1) (taking <m>Y=X'</m>) there is a continuous function <m>f\colon X'\rightarrow X</m> satisfying <m>\pi_i'=\pi_i\circ f</m>. Similarly, since <m>X'</m> also satisfies the product mapping property, we have (now taking <m>X=Y</m> in (1)) a continuous map <m>g\colon X\rightarrow X'</m> satisfying <m>\pi_i=\pi_i'\circ g</m>.
          I claim <m>f\circ g=\id_X</m> and <m>g\circ f=\id_{X'}</m>: <ie />, <m>g=f^{-1}</m> is a continuous inverse of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism between <m>X'</m> and <m>X</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see why we use the <em>uniqueness</em> claim in the product mapping property (twice). Indeed, the function <m>f\circ g\colon X\rightarrow X</m> is continuous and satisfies
          <me>
            \pi_i\circ (g\circ f)=(\pi_i\circ g)\circ f=\pi_i'\circ f=\pi_i
          </me>
          for all <m>i\in I</m>. But the function <m>\id_X\colon X\rightarrow X</m> also satisfies <m>\pi_i=\pi_i\circ\id_X</m> for all <m>i\in I</m>. By the uniqueness claim of the product mapping property, we conclude <m>\id_X=f\circ g</m>, as desired. The proof that <m>g\circ f=\id_{X'}</m> is nearly identical, now applying the product mapping propery to maps into <m>X'</m>.

    Assume <m>f</m> is continous and invertible throughout. To be a homeomorphism we need <m>g=f^{-1}</m> to be continuous.

      Don't be mislead by <xref ref="th_homeo_open_closed"/> into thinking that being an open continuous map is equivalent to being a closed continuous map; we need the additional assumption of invertibility to guarantee equivalence.

  <title>Continuous bijection onto circle</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>X=[0,1)\subseteq \R</m> and  <m>S^1=\{(x,y)\in \R^2\colon x^2+y^2=1\}\subseteq \R^2</m>, and equip each set with the subspace topology inherited from <m>\R</m> (resp. <m>\R^2</m>) with its Euclidean topology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prove: the function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow S^1</m> defined as <m>f(t)=(\cos 2\pi t, \sin 2\pi t)</m> is continuous and invertible, but not a homeomorphism.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Recall first that on <m>\R^2=\R\times \R</m> the product topology, Euclidean metric topology, and box topology are all equal.
      Since <m>f_1(x)=\cos 2\pi t</m> and <m>f_2(x)=\sin 2\pi t</m> are continuous, it follows from <xref ref="th_product_universal_prop"/> that the map <m>g\colon [0,1)\rightarrow \R\times \R=\R^2</m> is continuous. Next, since <m>g=i\circ f</m>,
      where <m>i\colon S^1\hookrightarrow \R^2</m>, it follows that <m>f</m> is continuous: indeed, for any open set <m>U\subseteq S^1</m>, we have <m>U=U'\cap S^1</m> for some open <m>U'\subseteq \R^2</m>, and <m>f^{-1}(U)=g^{-1}(U')</m>, which is open since <m>g</m> is continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual trigonometric arguments show that <m>f</m> is injective and surjective. However, <m>f</m> is not open, and hence not a homeomorphism. Indeed, let <m>U=[0,1/2)</m>, which is open in <m>[0,1)</m>. The image <m>f(U)</m> is easily seen to be the upper half of the circle minus the point <m>Q=(-1,0)</m>: in particular, all points <m>f(U)</m> have nonnegative <m>y</m>-coordinates. On the other hand, we have <m>(1,0)\in f(U)</m> and with respect to the subspace topology on <m>S^1</m> any open set containing <m>(1,0)</m> contains elements of <m>S^1</m> whose <m>y</m>-coordinate is negative. It follows that <m>f(U)</m> is not open.
