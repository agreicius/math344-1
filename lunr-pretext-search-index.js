  "body": " Sets and functions    We gather here some notions about sets and functions.    Sets   sets  sets empty sets  sets membership      set membership   Sets   A set is a collection of objects. An object is a member (or element ) of a set if contains . In this case, we write . If is not a member of , we write .    We use curly braces to describe the contents of a set. For example, is the set containing the first three positive integers, and is the set of all positive integers. The defining property of sets is that they are completely determined by their members, and nothing more. In particular, when describing sets as above, it does not matter in what order the elements are listed, nor if they are repeated: , , , and are three descriptions of the same set. This somewhat slippery notion is made perfectly clear by specifying exactly what it means for two sets to be equal, as we do below.   Set equality  sets equality   Sets and are equal , denoted , if they have precisely the same elements: , if for any object , we have if and only if .    Set membership naturally extends to a notion of one set lying within another.   Set inclusion (subsets)  sets subset  sets inclusion    set inclusion    A set is a subset of a set , denoted , if every member of is a member of : , implies for any object . The relation is called set inclusion .      The definitions of set equality and the subset relation make use of two important logical operations: namely, the if and only if (or iff for short) and if-then operations.    With the fundamental notions of membership, equality, and subset in place, we now introduce means of building new sets from existing ones. The first is a manner of carving out a subset of a given set using a specified property.   Set-builder notation  sets set builder notation   Let be a set, and let be a property that elements of either satisfy or do not satisfy. For an element , let denote the statement that satisfies . The set of all elements of satisfying is denoted .      Set builder notation is parsed from left to right as follows:    is read as the set of      is read as elements of      is read as such that      is read as is true .   Taken altogether we get: The set of elements of such that is true .      Let be the set of nonnegative integers. The subset of even positive integers can be described using set-builder notation as , or alternatively, .    Next we use set builder notation, the set membership relation, and some basic logic to define the union, intersection, and difference of sets.   Union, intersection, difference, and complement  sets union  sets intersection    set union     set intersection   sets complement  sets difference      set difference     set complement    Let and be subsets of a common set .    Set union  The union  of and is defined as . More generally, if is a set and is a collection of sets indexed by , then the union  of this collection is defined as .    Set intersection  The intersection  of and is defined as . More generally, if is a set and is a collection of sets indexed by , then the intersection  of this collection is defined as     Set difference  The difference  is defined as .    Set complement  The complement of in is defined as . In contexts where there is clear what the larger set is, we denote the complement of in as .      With the help of these set operations, we can now describe some common sets used in mathematics.   sets empty set     the empty set   real numbers    real numbers   integers    integers     positive integers   rational numbers    rational numbers   Common mathematical sets   We denote by the set of all real numbers. The integers  and rational numbers  are the subsets of defined as . This yields the following chain of subsets: . The empty set is the set containing no objects, denoted or .  The set of all positive integers is denoted .    The power set of a set is the set of all subsets of . We will make use of this notion in our very first definition ( ).   power set    power set of   Power set   Given a set , its power set  is defined as the set of all subsets of .     Power set   Let . The power set is the set of all subsets of . We can enumerate systematically by listing all the subsets in order of increasing cardinality. There is one subset of containing zero elements: namely, the empty set . The two subsets of containing exactly one element are and . Lastly, the unique subset of containing two elements is itself. We conclude that . In general if has cardinality , then has cardinality .    Lastly, we define the cartesian product of sets, which is a formal description of an ordered collection of objects.   Cartesian product      Cartesian product   Cartesian product (finite)   An -tuple (or sequence ) of the sets is an ordered list such that for all . We define two -tuples , and to be equal, denoted , if for all . We call the length of the sequence , and we call its -th entry for all .  The (Cartesian) product of the sets , denoted or , is the set of all -tuples: , .  Given a set , its -ary Cartesian product  is defined as .      We have more suggestive names for -tuples when is small: a 2-tuple is called a pair, a 3-tuple is called a triple, a 4-tuple is called a quadruple, . We will use the generic term tuple to designate a -tuple of unspecified length.      Observe how tuples capture the notion of an ordered collection of object. For example, whereas the sets and are all equal to one another, the 4-tuples and are not: they differ in their second entries.  What about the tuples and ? Are these equal? Technically our definition of equality only applies to tuples living in the same fixed Cartesian product. In particular, for the question of equality to make sense, the tuples must have the same length. As such we will officially avoid writing things like , although unofficially we consider these two objects as completely different. You should think of and as creatures living on two different planets in the universe of tuples.    The notion of a Cartesian product can be generalized to an infinite list of sets , and indeed to any collection indexed by a set .   tuple arbitrary    -tuple   I-tuple   Let be a set. Given a set , an -tuple of elements of is a function . Given an -tuple and element we will often denote the value as , and denote itself as . In analogy to finite tuples, we call the -th entry or coordinate of .     Cartesian product arbitrary    Cartesian product of the sets   Cartesian product (arbitrary)   Let be a set, and let be a collection of subsets indexed by the set . The Cartesian product  of this collection is defined as . In other words, the Cartesian product is the set of all -tuples of elements of whose -th coordinate is an element of for all .      Functions   Functions  function    a function from to    Let and be two sets. A function from to , denoted , is a rule which, given any input  , returns an output  . In this case we write and call the image of under , or the value of at  . Similarly, we say  maps (or sends ) the input to the output .  The set is called the domain of ; the set is called the codomain of .  When we wish to indicate what rule defines the function, we use the elaborated notation . This is read as The function with domain and codomain maps an input to the output .      Consider the function . This function has domain and codomain equal to and maps an integer to its square.     Arithmetic operations as functions   Our familiar arithmetic operations can be expressed as functions whose inputs are pairs of numbers: addition is the function and multiplication is the function       Invoking the notion of a rule in the definition of a function is admittedly somewhat vague. A more precise definition can be given using the Cartesian product. Namely, given sets and , we define a function to be a subset satisfying the following property: for all there is a unique element . The uniqueness of the pair then allows us to define the value of at as , denoted .    As with sets and tuples, we are obliged to specify what we mean for two functions to be equal. The definition below makes clear how the the domain and codomain, as well as the rule that takes inputs to outputs, are all essential ingredients of a function.   Function equality  function equality   Functions and are equal if   they have the same domain and codomain , and    for all , we have .        Image of a set  function image of a set  function image    image of the set under     image of a function    Given a function and a subset , the image of under , denoted , is defined as . In other words, is the set of all outputs , where .  The image of , denoted , is the set of all outputs of : , .     Injective, surjective, bijective  invertible function  bijective function  injective function  surjective function  one-to-one function  onto function  one-to-one correspondence   Let be a function.   The function is injective (or one-to-one ) if for all , if , then : equivalently, if , then .    The function is surjective (or onto ) if for all , there is an such that : equivalently, .    The function is bijective (or a one-to-one correspondence ) if it is injective and surjective.        Role of domain and codomain in injectivity and surjectivity   Consider the following three functions . Although all three functions are defined using the same rule ( ), they are not equal thanks to their differing domains and\/or codomains. The choice of domain and codomain in these examples also plays a crucial role in determining whether the function is injective and\/or surjective. The function is neither injective ( ) nor surjective ( ); the function is injective but not surjective; the function is both injective and surjective, hence bijective.     Function composition  function composition    the composition of and    Suppose and are functions satisfying . The composition of and is the function defined as , for all .     function invertible  function inverse  function identity  Identity and inverse functions   For any set the identity function on is the function defined as for all .  A function is invertible if there is a function satisfying and : , . The function in this case is called the inverse of , denoted .    Invertible is equivalent to bijective   A function is invertible if and only if it is bijective.       Cardinality and countability   Cardinality  cardinality  finite set  infinite set  countably infinite set  countable set  uncountable set    cardinality of set    Let be a set.    Finite and infinite sets  The set is finite if either or there is a bijection for some positive integer . Roughly speaking, the cardinality of a finite set , denoted , is the number of distinct elements it contains. In more detail if , then by definition; if there is a bijection , then .  The set is infinite if it is not finite. In this case is said to have infinite cardinality .    Countable and uncountable sets  The set is countably infinite if there is a bijection , where is the set of all positive integers; it is countable if it is either finite or countable infinite.  The set is uncountable if it is not countable.       "

A truth table of a compound proposition is a concise way of displaying how the truth value of depends on the truth values of its component propositions. It contains one row for each possible truth assignment of the component propositions. As illustration, we give the truth tables for the logical operators defined above:       Use a truth table to find all truth value assignments of and making the compound proposition false.    We construct a truth table with columns for , , , , and : . We conclude that is false exactly when is false and is true. (It follows that is equivalent to . )      Our definitions of the logical operators above are chosen to agree with their usage in a very particular type of discourse: namely, mathematical discourse. They do not always agree with their use in natural language: hence the modifier logical in their titles.  For example, disjunctions in natural language of the form or are often understood to be true when is true or is true, but not both . This notion of disjunction is called the exclusive or in logic, in contrast to the standard logical or.  Similarly, according to our definition, the implication If the President of the US is a dog, then the Vice President of the US is a cat is true, since the proposition The President of the US is a dog is false. (In logic we say the implication is vacuously true in this case.) However, working outside of our logical definitions of truth value, we may have been inclined to treat this implication as false, since both The President of the US is a dog and The Vice President of the US is a cat are false.      Predicate logic  Propositions like All humans are mortal and Every positive real number has a square-root are modeled in logic in the form For all , and For all , there exists an such that , where stands for the phrase is mortal and stands for the phrase is a square-root of . Observe that and on their own are not propositions; there is no truth value to is mortal or is a square-root of . Instead, we think of and as functions which return propositions when evaluated at a specific choice for , or for and . For example, evaluating at yields the proposition Aaron Greicius is mortal , which happens to be true at the time of writing. Similarly evaluating at yields the proposition is a square-root of 2 , which happens to be false. In logic and are called propositional functions (also called predicates ): functions whose outputs are propositions.  The propositions For all , and For all , there exists an such that are obtained from and by bounding them with a series of quantifiers ( , for all , there exists an ). The definition below allows us to assign truth values to such propositions.    Let be a set, and let be a propositional function that assigns to all elements the proposition . The set is called the domain of discourse of .    Universal quantifier  The proposition For all in , , denoted in logical notation, is called a universal quantification , and its truth value is defined as follows: is true if for all elements of , the proposition is true; it is false if there is some such that is false.    Existential quantifier  The proposition There exists an in such that , denoted in logical notation, is called an existential quantification , and its truth value is defined as follows: is true if there is some element of for which the proposition is true; it is false if is false for all .       Truth depends on domain of discourse   Just as a function is not properly defined before its domain is specified, we do not have a well-defined propositional function, nor well-defined truth values of propositions built from this propositional function, until its domain of discourse is given.  For example, let be x>0 . If we declare , then the proposition is true, since by definition every is positive. On the other hand, if we declare , the proposition is false since not all elements of are positive: indeed, is negative, making false.  Because of the important role played by the domain of discourse , we sometimes include it in our quantifier expressions: , , . Using this convention allows us to see more immediately that is true and is false.     Modeling Every positive number has a square-root   Model the sentence Every positive real number has a square-root in the form , where is a propositional function with domain of discourse . Determine the truth value of using .    Fix our domain of discourse to be . For any , let be the proposition that is a square-root of . Define to be the propositional function . Thus for any , is the proposition that if is positive, then has a square-root. It follows that is the proposition that for all real numbers , if is positive, then has a square-root. This is clearly equivalent to the proposition that every positive real number has a square-root, as desired.  Lastly, we use to show is true. Take any . The real number is either positive or not positive. If is not positive, then is false and hence , which is the implication , is true vacuously. If is positive, then is true, and is true, since has a square-root in this case: namely, . But if is true and is true, then the implication is true. We have proved is true for all . Thus is true.     Order of quantifiers matters   As illustrates, we can take a propositional function in two variables and quantify one of the two variables to obtain a propositional function in one variable: , or . Proceeding in this manner we engender propositions involving sequences of quantifiers. Mark well that the order of the quantifiers in such sequences is important!  For example, letting be is a square-root of with domain of discourse . The proposition says that every positive real number has a positive square-root (true); the proposition says that there is a positive real number that is the square-root of all real numbers (false).  In general to unpack a sequence of quantifiers we start from the leftmost quantifier and proceed to the right.     Negating quantifiers   Let be a propositional function with domain of discourse . According to a universal quantification is false if it is not the case that is true for all for all ; that is, if there is some such that is false. Letting be the propositional function defined as for all , we see that is false if and only if is true. This proves the equivalence . Similarly, we have . These equivalences can be understood as rules of negating quantifier statements. They can be summarized as follow: swap quantifiers and negate the predicate.     The example below taken from calculus nicely illustrates how to negate a proposition that involves a sequence of quantifiers.   The limit does not exist   Let be a function with domain , and let be a point of this domain. By definition, the proposition that exists is equivalent to the following proposition: . (We made a number of shortcuts in our logical notation above (  , ) in order to simplify the expression somewhat; the intended meaning should still be clear. )  Use the negation rules described in to derive a similar proposition equivalent to the statement that do not exist.    Let be the proposition in . Using the negation rules in series, we derive the chain of equivalences below. We've added parentheses to emphasize what is being negated at each step. Note how a quantifiers are swapped each time we pass the negation to the right. . (The last link in our chain uses the fact that is equivalent to , as a truth table easily shows.) Translating back into English, we conclude that the limit not existing ( ) is equivalent to the following: for every there is an such that for all there exists an satisfying and . Quite a mouthful!     "

  "body": " Proof techniques  Proof writing is an art, a technical skill you will hone and refine throughout your career; and like any art, proof writing has many tricks of the trade. We gather a few here in the form of a collection of general proof techniques. Part of mastering these techniques involves understanding the circumstances where they can be of use. When selecting a technique, we are guided in part by the logical structure and particular mathematical content of the proposition under consideration. The proof techniques below are organized under this guiding principle.   Logical structure   Implication  By the only time an implication is false is when is true and is false. Accordingly, the direct approach to proving an implication is to assume is true, and use this assumption to prove is true.  A common indirect approach used to prove an implication is to prove its contrapositive  , which is logically equivalent to the original implication. In this case we assume is not true, and show is not true. (Exercise: use a truth table to show the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.)    The converse of an implication is the implication ; the inverse of is the implication . Neither the converse nor the inverse is equivalent to the original implication, and thus neither of these can be used to give an indirect proof of . (Exercise: use a truth table to show that neither the converse nor the inverse implication is logically equivalent to the original implication. )      Disjunction  Again, using , to directly show a disjunction is true, we need only show one the two component propositions is true.  Alternatively, we can prove either of the implications or , both of which are logically equivalent to . (Exercise: use a truth table to show these three propositions are indeed equivalent!)    Equivalence The equivalence is logically equivalent to the conjunction . Accordingly, the standard way of proving is to prove the two implications and separately. (Exercise: use a truth table to show these propositions are indeed equivalent!)   Chains of implications\/equivalences  The relation implies is transitive: , if and , then . Similarly, the relation is equivalent to is transitive. This allows us to prove an implication or equivalence via a chain of implications or chain of equivalences . When writing up a proof using this technique, use a vertically aligned format like the example below, treating one implication or equivalence per line, and adding a brief justification to the right: . It is also possible to build an argument as a hybrid chain of equivalences and implications. In this case the chain is only as strong as its weakest link. For example, a chain of the form only shows that . Indeed, we will have if and only if the intervening implication is in fact an equivalence ( , the arrow goes both ways).    It is often tempting, for the sake of space, to try and prove an equivalence via a chain of equivalences, as opposed to showing and separately. When proceeding in this manner, make doubly sure that each is indeed an equivalence: , that the implication arrow really goes both ways at each step. Even if each step in your chain truly is an equivalence, you should consider whether this will be obvious to your reader.    The example below provides the proof that a function is invertible if and only if it is bijective ( ). The proof nicely illustrates some of the different techniques used for proving implications and equivalences. Additionally, it is a nice example of how to separate out cases of the argument into clearly distinguished steps.   Proof: invertible is equivalent to bijective   Let be a function. Prove: is invertible if and only if is bijective.    Let be the proposition that is invertible, and let be the proposition that is bijective. We prove the equivalence by proving the two implications and .   Proof of  We must show that if is invertible, then is bijective. Assume is invertible. Then has an inverse . We show separately that is injective and surjective, hence bijective.   is injective  We show via a chain of implications: .    is surjective  Let be an element of . We must show that there is an such that . Letting , we have .     Proof of  We must show that if is bijective, then is invertible. Assume is bijective. First we define a function as follows: for all , let be the unique element such that . Note that our definition of uses both that is surjective (there is some element such that )) and injective (there is exactly one element such that ).  We now prove that is the inverse of , showing and separately.    Take any and let . By definition of , we have and hence . This proves .     Take any . By definition of , is the unique such that . Thus . This proves .        Proof by contradiction The technique of proof by contradiction (or reductio ad absurdum ) proves a proposition by (a) assuming the negation is true, and then (b) using this assumption to derive a proposition known to be false. The choice of falsehood is completely up to the person providing the proof. However, in order for the proof to be convincing, it should be clear, either logically or because of theory assumed to be known, that is indeed false.  Proof by contradiction   Prove by contradiction that has no multiplicative inverse in the reals: , there is no such that .    We prove the claim by contradiction. Assume there is an such that . Since for any (a property of multiplication by 0), we have : a contradiction since . We conclude that there is no such that .      Proof by contradiction resembles, but is not quite the same thing as proving an implication via its contrapositive. Letting denote an arbitrary falsehood (the described above) what we do in a proof by contradiction is show that the implication is true. Since is false, and the implication is true, must be false: equivalently, must be true.       Equalities   Equality is not as simple as it may seem. In general an equality is a mathematical statement of the form . Here LHS and RHS stand for left- and right-hand side, respectively. What exactly such an equality means depends very much on what kind of mathematical objects the two sides of the equation are: , numbers, sets, functions, etc. Below we discuss equality for objects of a particular type in detail. (See and .) In all settings, the notion of equality will be transitive : , if and , then . We use transitivity implicitly when proving an equality via a chain of equalities as described below.    Chain of equalities Often to prove an equality as in we proceed in a sequence of intervening bite-size equalities, each of which is easy for the reader to digest. As with chains of implications\/equivalences, we present such an argument in a vertically aligned format, with brief justifications to the right: .  Never attempt to prove an equality by starting off with the equality you wish to prove, and then deduce a series of further equalities ending in some inanity: , . What this suggests is that you are in fact proving an implication: namely, if the desired equality is true, then  . Clearly this is not what we set out to prove! This type of fallacious argument is called begging the question ( petitio princippii in Latin), as we assume that which was to be proven.      Basic set properties   Set inclusion  Let and be sets. By , to prove we must show that for all elements we have . This requires proving the implication above for a general element , and we may use any of the techniques described in and to do so.    Set equality  Let and be sets. To prove directly using we must show that for all elements we have . To prove this universal equivalence, we must give an argument for the equivalence that holds for a general element .  Alternatively, you can prove by proving the two set inclusions and separately. This is equivalent to proving the two implications and separately.     Basic function properties   Function equality  By , in order to show functions and are equal we must   show that and have the same domain and codomain , and    show that for all .    By The universal quantifier for all of item (ii) gives this subtask the feel of proving an identity : we must show that equality holds for all  . By the same token, to show (ii) does not hold, it suffices to show that for some .   Injective, surjective, bijective  Let be a function.   Injectivity  To show is injective, we must show that the implication holds for all . Frequently it will be convenient to prove the (universal) contrapositive: for all .  Similarly, to show is not injective, we simply have to find satisfying and .    Surjectivity  To prove is surjective, we must prove the universal quantification: . To prove is not surjective, we must prove the negation of this proposition ( ): , there exists a for which there is no with .    Bijectivity  To show is bijective directly using , we must show that is injective and surjective. This is equivalent to showing that for there exists a unique element such that .  Alternatively, using we can show that is bijective by providing an inverse function .      mathematical induction  Mathematical induction    Mathematical induction is a technique for proving universal quantifications of the form , where is a fixed starting integer, called the base , and is a predicate defined on the integers. If the setting makes clear that ranges over integers, we write such propositions using logical notation as .    mathematical induction weak induction  Proof by induction  Suppose is a predicate of integers. To prove the proposition by induction (sometimes called weak induction ), we proceed in two steps.   Base step  Show that is true.    Induction step  Prove the universal implication . In practice, if proving the implication directly, this means we assume is true (the induction hypothesis ), and use this assumption to show is true.    Step 0 of induction   When meeting a proposition in the wild that we wish to prove by induction, you should first take care to model the proposition in the form . Make explicit the predicate in question, as well as the base case . We illustrate this preparatory Step 0 in the examples below.     Weak induction   Prove the identity for all . Recall: .    We prove the proposition by induction.   Step 0: preparation  The proposition is modeled logically as , where is the proposition that .    Base step:  The proposition is the statement that , which is clearly true.    Induction step  We must show the universal implication . Let , and assume is true: , The proposition states that . We prove this, assuming , via a chain of equalities: , as desired.   Having completed our base and induction steps, our proof is now finished.    So why does proof by induction work? In other words, why is it a valid proof technique? Imagine our propositions as forming an infinite ladder that we wish to ascend. Cautious climbers that we are, we only will step on a rung if we know the corresponding proposition is true. Knowing is true (the base step) allows us to step onto the first rung. The universal implication (induction step) gives us a rule that says if rung is secure (i.e., true), then so is rung . Since this rule holds for all rungs (i.e., for all ), we can safely ascend the entire ladder!  Mathematical induction as ladder of propositions  Mathematical induction as ladder of propositions          mathematical induction strong induction  Proof by strong induction  Suppose is a predicate of integers. To prove the proposition by strong induction , we proceed in two steps.   Base step:  Show that is true.    Strong induction step  Prove the universal implication . This technique is called strong induction, as now the induction hypothesis is much stronger: to prove this implication directly we assume is true for all (not just as in weak induction), and use this assumption to show is true.   In fact, strong induction is, logically speaking, no stronger than weak induction. Both techniques apply to propositions of the form , and you are free to choose which form of induction to use each time. We typically use strong induction out of convenience, when the nature of the predicate is such that we can prove most elegantly by assuming , as opposed to just . The following example is characteristic in this regard.   Strong induction   Prove that every integer can be written as a product of primes.    We prove the statement by induction.   Step 0: preparation  The proposition is modeled logically as , where is the proposition that is a product of primes.    Base step:  The proposition asserts that is a product of primes. This is true since is itself prime, hence a product of one prime number.    Strong induction step  We must show the universal implication . Let , and assume is true for all : , for all such we assume can be written as a product of primes. We use this assumption to prove : , that is a product of primes. We proceed in two cases, depending on whether is itself prime.   Case 1: is prime  If is prime, then it is trivially a product of one prime number, just as with the base case.    Case2 : is not prime  If is not prime, then we can factor nontrivially as . Here nontrivially means that we have . Using the strong induction hypothesis, we may assume that and are both products of primes: , we have , where and are prime for all and . It follows that , and hence that is also a product of primes, as desired.    Having completed the base and induction steps, our proof by induction is now finished.      "

  "title": "Topological spaces",
  "body": " Topological spaces   The real numbers come equipped with a notion of nearness or closeness furnished by the absolute value function: namely, we define the distance between real numbers as . From this simple bit of structure springs all the fundamental concepts of real analysis: Cauchy sequences, limits, continuous functions, etc.  Topology can be seen as a vast generalization of this notion that abstracts away from the absolute value function, relying instead on the more abstract idea of open sets . Indeed, the notion of openness is introduced already in real analysis: a set is open if for all there is an such that if , then . Intuitively, you can think of this property as stating that has a certain roomy or generous nature: if , and is sufficiently close to , then has room for too. Come on in!  We view the the three conditions of as an attempt at axiomatizing this notion of openness (or roominess). This is the starting point of topology. The generality of this approach is part of topology's great power. We can define a notion of open sets on any set whatsoever: , we can choose a collection of subsets (called a topology ) that satisfies the axioms of . Furthermore, for a given set there are typically many distinct ways of making this choice; your topology on can be tailor-made to suit your particular needs. Beyond this generality and flexibility, the other key to topology's effectiveness is its ability to transport to any topological space the concepts of continuity, limits, connectedness, and compactness familiar to us from real analysis. Once a set is given the structure of a topological space, these notions can be used as powerful tools for investigating its properties. It is for this reason that topology plays an important role in essentially all mathematical fields: analysis, geometry, algebraic geometry, number theory, etc.    Topological space   A topological space is a pair , where is a set, and is a collection of subsets of satisfying the following axioms:   Trivial sets   and     Closed under arbitrary unions  Given any collection of elements , we have     Closed under finite intersections  If , then .   In this case we call a topology on , and an element is called an open set of . Although technically speaking a topological space is a pair , we often omit mention of the topology if there is no risk of confusion.     Equivalent alternative to axioms (1)-(3)   Using induction, we can show that if satisfies axiom (3) for any two elements of , then it satisfies it for any elements, for arbitrary. In other words if we replace axiom (3) with   (3')  If , then    , we get an equivalent definition of a toplogical space. When verifying whether a given is a topological space it may be more convenient to use axiom (3') as opposed to axiom (3).     Euclidean topology on   Let and define to be the set of open sets as defined above: that is, if and only if for all there is an such that the entire open interval is contained in . Show that is a topology on          Trivial and discrete topology Let be a set.   The collection is a topology on , called the trivial topology . This is the topology on whose only open sets are the empty set and itself.    The collection is a topology on , called the discrete topology . This is the topology on for which every subset of is an open set.        Let . By definition the given contains and , and thus axiom (1) is satisfied. Since any union or intersection involving and is equal to either or , it is clear that is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Thus axioms (2)-(3) are satisfied.    Let . By definition, is the set of all subsets of . In particular, it contains and , and thus axioms (1) is satisfied. Furthermore, since any union or intersection of subsets of is again a subset of , we see that axioms (2)-(3) are satisfied.        Some small topological spaces   For each set describe all subsets that satisfy the axioms of , and hence make a topological space.

Thus there are exactly 4 distinct topologies we can define on .       Cofinite topology  Let be a set. A subset is cofinite in if is finite. The collection of subsets is a topology, called the cofinite topology . In this topology a subset is open if and only if it is either empty or cofinite.   We treat each axiom separately.
