<div class="para">Observe how tuples capture the notion of an <em class="emphasis">ordered</em> collection of object. For example, whereas the sets <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 1, 2, 3\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,2,3\}\)</span> are all equal to one another, the 4-tuples <span class="process-math">\((1,1,2,3)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1,2,2,3)\)</span> are not: they differ in their second entries.</div> <div class="para">What about the tuples <span class="process-math">\((1,1,1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1,1,1,1)\text{?}\)</span> Are these equal? Technically our definition of equality only applies to tuples living in the same fixed Cartesian product. In particular, for the question of equality to make sense, the tuples must have the same length. As such we will officially avoid writing things like <span class="process-math">\((1,1,1)\ne (1,1,1,1)\text{,}\)</span> although unofficially we consider these two objects as completely different. You should think of <span class="process-math">\((1,1,1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1,1,1,1)\)</span> as creatures living on two different planets in the universe of tuples.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_sets_functions.html#rm_tuple_ordered" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
