<div class="para">Note: the argument for the forward direction uses the axiom of choice potentially. If that bugs you, consider the following alternative: let <span class="process-math">\(I=\{(U,y)\colon U\text{ open neighborhood of } x, y\in U\cap A\}\)</span> with quasiordering <span class="process-math">\((U,y)\leq (U', y')\iff U\supseteq U'\text{.}\)</span>  (This is no longer a partial ordering necessarily.) Define <span class="process-math">\(f\colon I\rightarrow X\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(f((U,y))=y\text{.}\)</span> This net also converges to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous and <span class="process-math">\((x_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> is a net satisfying <span class="process-math">\(x_i\rightarrow x\text{.}\)</span> Given any open set <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> the net <span class="process-math">\((x_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> is eventually in <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(U)\text{,}\)</span> since this is an open set containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> But then clearly <span class="process-math">\((f(x_i))_{i\in I}\)</span> is eventually in <span class="process-math">\(f(f^{-1}(U))\subseteq U\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">Inversely, if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not continuous, then there is an <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> and open set <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> such that for all open sets <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> there is an element <span class="process-math">\(y_V=f(x_V)\in f(V)\cap (Y-U)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> be the set of all open neighborhoods of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> with partial ordering given by reverse inclusion, and consider the net <span class="process-math">\((x_V)_{V\in I}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x_V\)</span> is the element described above.
